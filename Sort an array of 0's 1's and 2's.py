arr = [0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1]
Output:
After sorting:
0 0 1 1 2 2

based on the value of the mid pointer.

The steps will be the following:

First, we will run a loop that will continue until mid <= high.
There can be three different values of mid pointer i.e. arr[mid]
If arr[mid] == 0, we will swap arr[low] and arr[mid] and will increment both low and mid. Now the subarray from index 0 to (low-1) only contains 0.
If arr[mid] == 1, we will just increment the mid pointer and then the index (mid-1) will point to 1 as it should according to the rules.
If arr[mid] == 2, we will swap arr[mid] and arr[high] and will decrement high. Now the subarray from index high+1 to (n-1) only contains 2.
In this step, we will do nothing to the mid-pointer as even after swapping, the subarray from mid to high(after decrementing high) might be unsorted. So, we will check the value of mid again in the next iteration.
